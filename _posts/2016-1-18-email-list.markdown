Your inbox. It can be a point of anxiety or your best friend, it’s all about managing what comes in and out of it. For the past 6 months, I’ve been operating at Inbox Zero and it is my number one productivity “hack.”
One piece of this strategy is being diligent about who I give the right to email me. That means, when checking out at the mall, always saying ‘no’ to ‘would you like emailed coupons?’ and instantly unsubscribing to newsletters that don’t benefit either me personally or my business. I like to keep an up-to-date list with the newsletters that I am subscribed to and want to share that with you.


## 18 of My Favorites For Learning

That’s it! Those are all my subscriptions that I engage with regularly. They all provide some sort of value to my life, otherwise they’d be gone in a heartbeat. If you have any suggestions for new ones, hit me up on Twitter!


p.s. to achieve inbox zero, I use Inbox.com by Google both on my browser and on my iOS devices. It’s incredibly powerful mixed with a handful of plugins (MixMax is the most notable). I am able to bring in all my POP3 and IMAP emails through gmail.com and can send/receive with all my personal emails and work emails through one tool. If I can’t immediately check the email in the “Done” category, I schedule it to return at a later time.
