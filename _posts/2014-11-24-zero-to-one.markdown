I was slightly skeptical when I first saw Peter Thiel's Zero To One pop up on the pre-order list on my ever-growing Amazon suggested purchases list. I knew Peter Thiel as one of the master minds included in the PayPal Mafia and even more so as an early investor in Facebook, so I assumed that the book would be full of "silicon-valley this" and "san-fransico that" and plenty of other technical startup mumbo jumbo (is this a real phrase?) that fills the headlines of Tech blogs and Entrepreneurship magazines. I underestimated Mr. Thiel.

Zero To One captured the essence of why the PayPal mafia was so successful without hammering too many PayPal specific elements. Thiel delivers just under 200 pages of forceful and crisp thoughts surrounding the true meaning of value generation. Most importantly, he opens up the economics book and discusses the impact startups have on the community we are building. 

I have snagged a few quotes from Thiel and share my own commentary on them. 

## 1. Zero to One
> _"Doing what we already know how to do takes the world from 1 to n...but every time we create something new, we go from 0 to 1."_

Whoops. I just spoiled the meaning of the title, but he does this on page 1, so I am not that apologetic. This shined a ray of light on my outlook of innovative stuff - I now mutter this to myself when pitched a business idea. It's so true...try this one on for size the next time someone pitches you an idea for the "next social network."

## 2. Start Small and Monopolize
> _"Dominate a small niche and scale up from there, toward your ambitious long-term vision"_  

This one is pretty apparent throughout the entire text. Imagine that you are the person that invented

Now, you may be thinking to yourself, "Self, this thing is going to practically sell itself! Here comes my first billion!" I love the enthusiasm, but what's the market? You're cuckoo to think "anyone who sleeps on a plane" is actually a valid answer. I'd rather hear you say that you are going to sell it to your dad and your crazy uncle because neither one of them care what other people think of them in public. Start small. Validate that people actually crave your product and scale accordingly!
