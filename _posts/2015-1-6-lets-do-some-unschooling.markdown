A few weeks ago, I shared lunch with a very good friend of mine and over the course of about two hours we talked about nearly everything on our minds, but one thing really stood out. He was about to graduate and I am only a semester away from finishing school and we both shared the same feeling about what it meant to be a "college graduate." An almost lack of enthusiasm. It seemed odd to the both of us that every semester, a few thousand students would walk away with the same stamp of approval from the university, but yet have drastically different experiences. What *actually* makes an individual *smart*? Is it the number of diplomas that they have or the number of courses that they have taken? Of course not. My friend and I both studied different flavors of engineering and as we looked back at the courses that we took in those four years, we struggled to even recall what some of them were about or why we were required (read: forced) to even study certain topics. This stuck with me. 

So why do we get college degrees? What is the relevance of what you study and the job that you actually secure? Most of the time, zippo. When a job posting states that a "BS is required," it usually just implies that the company is seeking a candidate with a specific skillset, a tenacity to complete a long winded goal, and a personality to boot. However, that doesn't come across on a resume. A diploma is a convenient categorization tool for recruiters to find employees when sifting through piles of resumes. But there is one big problem: employers require skills, not degrees. 

I am not suggesting that a college degree is not worth anything, far from it. The breadth of learning that can be accomplished while in school is incredible. Formal education is hugely important. Trust me, I don't want a college-dropout surgeon who decided that medicine school "wasn't for him" to operate on me. What I am suggesting is that there are distinctly different learning paths and both should be explored in depth. Learn new skills that you may not learn in school and not only because it may help you land a sweet new job, but because you will become a more well-rounded and intersting person. 

I encourage you join me on a journey this year. A journey of learning, but not in the typical sense. Harness that inner curiosity that you typically silence for a fear or embaressment or failure. Let's try a different type of learning. 

### _Unschooling Yourself_

Unschooling yourself is more a change in mentality. An eagerness to learn outside of the classroom or workplace. I share with you some suggestions that I believe may aid you in this process. Whether you are out of school or still in school, these suggestions will still apply.

## _1. Brag about your mistakes_



I can't stress this enough. 
-Continuously reading - Finding favorite blogs to follow, actually reading articles that you stumble upon on the web. Use the internet productively
-Stop comparing yourself to others: if you are learning something new, you are not going to start off as John Mayer
-Brag about mistakes!

Always ask why. It's your backbone. I'll leave you with this quote.
