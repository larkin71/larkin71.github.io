A few weeks ago, I shared lunch with a very good friend of mine and over the course of about two hours we talked about nearly everything on our minds, but one thing really stood out. He was about to graduate and I am only a semester away from finishing school and we both shared the same feeling about what it meant to be a "college graduate." An almost lack of enthusiasm. It seemed odd to the both of us that every semester, a few thousand students would walk away with the same stamp of approval from the university, but yet have drastically different experiences. What *actually* makes an individual *smart*? Is it the number of diplomas that they have or the number of courses that they have taken? Of course not. My friend and I both studied different flavors of engineering and as we looked back at the courses that we took in those four years, we struggled to even recall what some of them were about or why we were required (read: forced) to even study certain topics. This stuck with me. 

So why do we get college degrees? What is the relevance of what you study and the job that you actually secure? Most of the time, zippo. When a job posting states that a "BS is required," it usually just implies that the company is seeking a candidate with a specific skillset, a tenacity to complete a long winded goal, and a personality to boot. However, that doesn't come across on a resume. A diploma is a convenient categorization tool for recruiters to find employees when sifting through piles of resumes. But there is one big problem: employers require skills, not degrees. 

I am not suggesting that a college degree is not worth anything, far from it. The breadth of learning that can be accomplished while in school is incredible. Formal education is hugely important. Trust me, I don't want a college-dropout doctor who decided that medicine school "wasn't for him" to operate on me. What I am suggesting is that there are distinctly different learning paths and both should be explored in depth. Learn new skills that you may not learn in school and not only because it may help you land a sweet new job, but because you will become a more well-rounded and intersting person. 

I encourage you join me on a journey this year. A journey of learning, but not in the typical sense. Harness that inner curiosity that you typically silence for a fear or embaressment or failure. Let's try a different type of learning. 

## _Unschooling Yourself_

Whether you are out of school or still in school, these suggestions will still apply. 
-Just show up: step outside the box 
-Continuously reading - Finding favorite blogs to follow, actually reading articles that you stumble upon on the web. Use the internet productively
-Stop comparing yourself to others: if you are learning something new, you are not going to start off as John Mayer
-Brag about mistakes!










Why? It's the toughest of the 6 interrogative words, but it's the most important one to understand. The answer, whether realistic or not, provides a backbone to all difficult life decisions. It's the one answer that you can firmly stand your ground with. And it's the answer that ultimately makes up your mind.  

In light of this, don't simply ask that question of the world around you, but of yourself. And do it frequently. This is the story that brought me to Designli.  

I've always enjoyed learning. Building, tinkering, and rebuilding. That's what defined me as a young kid. Engineering always seemed to be a natural blend of everything that was fun for me, so I came to Ohio State to pursue a degree as a mechanical engineer. Ohio State has one of the _coolest_ first year programs for nerdy engineers. For 6 months, they submerge you into the world of engineering design. A rapid learning environment with a lesson in drafting, CAD, C++ programming, data analysis in MATLAB, report creation, circuit design, proper testing procedures, and experimentation. Come spring quarter, this all culminated into the annual robot design challenge, which is essentially a quest to build the most badass robot that could [autonomously navigate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4sgyj9rT7g) a course through a crafty blend of obstacles. I loved it. 

For most, including myself, this was a brand, spanking, new way of education. Learning by doing. I was in my element. Spending my days and nights looking through lines of code and throwing the robot onto the course for a 1500th time to guarantee that it would not crap out through certain turns and maneuvers. 

Fast forward to the present. I am now a graduate student studying aerospace engineering at the same university. I run the entrepreneruship organization on campus and have launched a handful of [other organizations](www.jakelarkin.co/#doings) that reflect my passions. Beyond those, I am also a graduate research associate participating in research that will fundamentally change the landscape of aerospace design. Our lab is aggressively tackling problems that were previously unsolvable and the work done by my colleagues is incredible. It sounds like a dream job for an engineer, right? It was for me, until I asked myself the inevitable question: why?

I found myself stuck in a doozy of an internal conflict. Did I really enjoy being a full-blown research engineer? Beyond explaining to people what I did in the research lab and seeing them look at me like, "Whaaaaat..?", the answer was no. I thought about everything that I had done in the past 4 years and _why_ I enjoyed them all individually. I loved starting and building _stuff_ that **actually** had an impact on the people surrounding me and beyond. I loved having a say in every part of the solution: engineering, branding, marketing, selling, hiring, everything! 

Plain and simple: **Life is so much better when you don't fake it.**

Everything that I was infatuated with pointed me towards entrepreneurship. The only thing that held me back was my prior perception of a successful career. I was nervous that if I didn't go chase a career as an engineer at a huge aerospace giant, that people would assume I was too stupid to get there. I now realize how terrible of a mindset that was and I am rushing with excitement to begin my next chapter with Designli. 

If you are reading this article, you and I likely have a shared interest in apps, startups or entrepreneurship. Since you have made it this far, I assume something I said has resonated with you. I want to dismantle some often proclaimed reasons to work in a startup.

## _1. You will be Ã¼ber rich_ 

No, no, no. Nonsense. Is there potential for wealth in the future? Maybe. But that will come in the form of value creation and that takes time. In order to get anywhere with a startup, you have to be comfortable without a salary. 

## _2. Setting your own schedule. Hooray!_

You do get to pick your own schedule! Take any given day and choose which 14 hours you want to work! If you are starting your own business because you don't like waking up early, then you'd be better off looking for a night shift. It's not about the schedule.

## _3. Be your own boss_

Well, yeah. You may be at the top of the leadership chain, but you can never avoid the feeling of someone telling you what to do. Whether it is your customer, your employees, your investors, or your mom...there will be someone telling you that you are wrong and that you need to do better. 

More importantly, I want to share why I have decided to ignore the typical career path with an aerospace degree and work at a startup:

## _1. The product_

At Designli, we are bringing the joy of launching a fully developed app to customers that would have previously never been able to see their dreams built. Involving the customer in the process and helping them shape their idea into a tangible design. We are empowering customers to create something magical. It's an exciting environment. 

## _2. The process_

When you work at a company with 100,000+ employees under it's belt, it's only natural that you will be placed into a silo pertaining to one task or a set of responsibilities. For some, this is powerful because they can hone their skill and become the master of their craft, but I honestly could not pick a single skill that I would ever be comfortable doing that with. At a startup, you are not responsible for a task, but more so an outcome. However that outcome is built will be up to you. Chase it until you can't chase anymore. 

## _3. The people_

There is something about entrepreneurs. An intangible, unexplainable passion for what they do and how they are going to get it done. How they are going to change the world. Back in the fall, the Designli team took a visit down to Greenville, South Carolina to find a place to set-up shop and it was the first time everyone was in the same room. The conversations between these friends were no longer about sports or getting drunk at a bar, but about how the world will look in 20 years and where we will be. These are the visionaries that I want to be around. The real **movers and shakers**.

## Remember...

Always ask why. It's your backbone. I'll leave you with this quote.
